"""
cpsm.platform.desktop_entry — generate and install a freedesktop.org .desktop
launcher entry for the CPSM GUI on Linux.

Spec: §9.7 (packaging).  Used by the ``cpsm install-desktop`` CLI subcommand
and by the AppImage / MSI builders during release.

Per-user install location:  ``$XDG_DATA_HOME/applications/cpsm.desktop``
                             (default ``~/.local/share/applications``)
System-wide:                ``/usr/local/share/applications/cpsm.desktop``

The icon is bundled at ``cpsm/resources/icons/cpsm.svg``.  When the launcher
is installed, the icon is also copied into the user's icon hicolor scalable
theme directory so app menus render it.
